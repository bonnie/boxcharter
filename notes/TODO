to do before forging on: 

* component loading states
* persist login on refresh
  * be sure to persist axios instance header as well, using token
* error boundaries / error handling
* data-test => test-id
* terminology: wrapper? dom? other??
* call setup.js automatically before every test (or just once before all tests...?)
* signin and signup have identical tests. Should they be the same component...?
* circleCI continuous integration
* send errors back to the server to log (middleware to do this...?)
  * server logging in general...?
* clarity alert component (tdd!)
  * move navlink into clarity directory
* server eslint

Done!
* proptypes
* eslint 
  * semicolons!!
  * make sure all functions have jsdoc
* axios instance / token header
