to do before forging on: 

* proptypes
* eslint 
  * semicolons!!
  * make sure all functions have jsdoc
* axios instance / token header
* component loading states
* persist login on refresh
* error boundaries / error handling
* data-test => test-id
* terminology: wrapper? dom? other??
* call setup.js automatically before every test (or just once before all tests...?)
* signin and signup have identical tests. Should they be the same component...?
* circleCI continuous integration
* send errors back to the server to log (middleware to do this...?)
* clarity alert component (tdd!)
