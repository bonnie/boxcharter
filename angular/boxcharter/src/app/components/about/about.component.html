<h2>About BoxCharter</h2>

<h3>Making Charts</h3>
<p>Use BoxCharter to make music charts with chords and lyrics (<a href="">see example</a>). Creating a chart is simple: </p>

  <ol class="list">
    <li>Create sections and measures.</li>
    <li>Configure the chart with specs such as:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>how many measures to display per row</li>
        <li>how many beats (or points at which the chord may change) per measure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add chords and lyrics.</li>
    <li>Download a PDF of your creation to share with friends.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Why do I need an account?</h3>
<p>In order to save your charts, they must be associated with a user account.</p>
